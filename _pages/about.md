Hi, I'm Uma! I'm from Gollaprolu 🏠, a charming small town in Andhra Pradesh, India 🇮🇳. I recently earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Clemson University 🎓, building on my undergraduate education in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIIT-RGUKT, Nuzvid 🏫.

With around four years of professionl experience in Machine Learning and Software Development 👨‍💻, I have worked on diverse projects that intersect Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering. My expertise lies in deploying complex machine learning models on edge devices and cloud environments. I’m deeply passionate about solving challenges in AI, Mathematics, and Software Engineering.

When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me playing table tennis 🏓 or badminton 🏸, catching a movie 🍿, or diving into a good book 📖. Currently, I’m enjoying The Vegetarian by Han Kang and Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. I also have a love for cooking 🔪, especially Indian cuisine. My butter chicken and biryani are family favorites!

I’m currently based in the United States 🇺🇸 and actively exploring new opportunities. If you think I’d be a great addition to your team or have an opportunity that matches my skills, feel free to reach out at maheshmeleti350@gmail.com.

Let’s connect and create something incredible together!
